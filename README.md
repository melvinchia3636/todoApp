<p align="center">A site aimed to help people keep track of their daily task and project progress.</p>

## The Problem

Arguably, the biggest obstacle in my entire coding journey is procrastination. When I'm free, I'll just sit there, wasting my life, and do nothing, putting behind all the unfinished works and projects. Hence, I desperately need something that reminds me of what I should do in my daily life.

## The Solution

So yeah, we'll make a website featured with a todo app and a project tracker.
